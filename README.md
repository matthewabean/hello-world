# hello-world
This is my initial repository based on the GitHub new user guide.

I am a graduating MBA student with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering, and a M.S. in Electrical Engineering with a focus on Optical Communications and Microelectronics/Semiconductors.

I have experience coding in: 
  MatLab - Numerical Analysis, Statical Regressions, Image Processing and Analysis, and Quantum State Modeling
  ##C++ - Numerical Analysis and basic Statistical Regressions, rudimentary Robotic Control Logic
  ##Wolphram Mathematica - Photonic Device Performance Modeling
  ##Basic Stamp - Basic robotic and control systems programming
  ##Motorola HC12 Microprocessor Assemply Programming
  Microsoft Office VBA programming - basic formatting and analysis programming
  R with RStudio - Data Analytics for Marketing purposes
  
The skills preceded with the double-pound sign are those that have atrophied to a large extent from non-use.
  
I am interested in refamiliarizing myself with programming, and in learning new languages, to help my children grow up with a familiarity and skill with programming.

I have always enjoyed tinkering hands-on with electronics, and would also like to be able to tinker with the software.
